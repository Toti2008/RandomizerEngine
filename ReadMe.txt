# Randomizer Engine

## Overview
The Randomizer Engine is a Python program that creates an interactive visual experience. It features a rapidly changing background, spinning polygons of various shapes, and dynamic sine wave notes played in the background.

## Features
- Randomly changing background colors
- Spinning polygons with random shapes and colors
- Dynamic sine wave notes played at random intervals
- Interactive control of shapes using keyboard keys (W, A, S, D)
- Toggle between a random background and a black background (Press 'B' key)
- Variable tweaking using UI sliders or text input (Default values: 100 - 200)

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pygame library
- Pygame GUI library (pygame_gui)

## Installation
1. Install Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Install Pygame: Open a terminal or command prompt and run: "pip install pygame"
3. Install Pygame GUI: Open a terminal or command prompt and run: "pip install pygame_gui"


## How to Run
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing "RandomizerEngine.py".
3. Run the program:


## Controls
- W, A, S, D: Change behavior of shapes and play a random sine wave note
- B: Toggle between random background and black background

## Tweakable Variables
You can tweak the following variables by pressing the corresponding keys (W, A, S, D):
- Randomness
- Min Shape
- Max Shape
- Min Shape Size
- Max Shape Size

## Explanation of Code
The code is written in Python using the Pygame library for graphics and user input. It utilizes Pygame GUI for UI elements. The program features a main loop that handles user input, updates the state, and renders the visual elements on the screen.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your preferences!

Note: The program may generate audio, so ensure your speakers are not too loud.

Enjoy the Randomness!
